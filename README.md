# Python API Challenge
The challenge is divided into two parts:

WeatherPy: Uses OpenWeatherMap API to fetch real-time weather data and generate visualizations.

VacationPy: Uses the weather data to suggest ideal vacation locations and visualize them on interactive maps
 WeatherPy notebook:

Generates random city locations using citipy.

Retrieves weather data (temperature, humidity, wind speed, cloudiness) using OpenWeatherMap API.

Creates scatter plots:

Latitude vs. Temperature

Latitude vs. Humidity

Latitude vs. Cloudiness

Latitude vs. Wind Speed

Performs linear regression for the Northern and Southern Hemispheres
 VacationPy Analysis

The VacationPy notebook:

Uses WeatherPy data to filter ideal vacation locations.

Uses Geoapify API & hvplot for interactive map visualizations.
Results & Visualizations

Key takeaways from the analysis:

Temperature decreases as latitude moves away from the equator.

Humidity, cloudiness, and wind speed have weak correlations with latitude.

Ideal vacation locations are filtered based on comfortable weather conditions.

Interactive maps help visualize the best travel destinations.
